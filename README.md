I LOVE THE NOISE !
trying to make a small project to discover js and websocket, i want to do a basic page with rooms and possibility to play annoying noises to each other in separate rooms.

to run locally you'll need python and npm, then just do this:
```bash
npm install
make start
```

to stop it the clean/easy way:
```bash
make stop
```
